Albert: hello, I am Albert.
Agnes: hello Albert, I'm Agnes.
Albert: It's very nice to meet you.
Agnes: The pleasure is all mine.
Albert: Would you like to get coffee some time, Agnes?
Agnes: I'd love to, Albert.
Albert: That's terrific. I know a great place. We can go and get lattes. Do you like lattes?
Agnes: I'm partial to capuccino myself. But I'll have a latte every now and then.
